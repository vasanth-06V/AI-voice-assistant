# AI-voice-assistant
This is my python project known as voice assistant

here I developed a interface for voice Assistant by using html,css,js.
then using using API, i integrated it with AI.

it performs the tasks like applications in desktop, searching in chrome browser, opening the required websites, then conversation with AI.
I also developed a chat interface to chat, where all above mentioned acctivities can be done.

how to work with this application:
1.After intiating the application, you need to add the required applications paths other than system applications in desktop like google chrome, microsoft edge,..etc.
2.you need to add the required websites you need to oprn.
3.for above two points, I have developed a interface to add them in the application.
4.now you are ready to use this application.

thank you,
